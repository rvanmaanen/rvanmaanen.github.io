Hi, I'm a consultant at [Xebia Microsoft Services](https://xebia.com/). Want to know more about my professional life? Check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/reiniervanmaanen/). For anything else about me, read on! 

In my spare time you can often find me mountainbiking or in the gym. Other things that make me happy are playing guitar, playing piano, listening to music, [photography](https://instagram.com/reiniervanmaanen), my motorbike, my friends and playing (board)games.
