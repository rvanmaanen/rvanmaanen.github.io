As consultant at [Xpirit](https://xpirit.com/team/reinier-van-maanen/), I have experience architecting and developing backend services based on the latest technologies and frameworks. I have led the large-scale redesign of a legacy platform and also helped a number of teams develop better software, not shying away from doing the "dirty" work like organizing a backlog. From idea to production, Iâ€™m always keeping the teams focused on delivering the best possible solutions, helping out customers like ABN AMRO, VolkerWessels, StackState, VismaRAET, TAQA and GeoStruct.

What drives me above all else is delivering quality software, based on the latest frameworks and technologies, together with a team of motivated people. I don't like giving up or settling for anything but the best. I'm always trying to improve: my skills, myself and the people around me.

In my spare time you can often find me mountainbiking or in the gym. Other things that make me happy are playing guitar, playing piano, listening to music, [photography](https://www.flickr.com/photos/193611797@N04/), my motorbike, my friends and playing (board)games.
