Reinier is lead developer/architect at Xpirit with a lot of experience developing backend services in an on-premise environment, based on the latest technologies and frameworks. He has been an architect for several years and the frontrunner in a large redesign of a legacy platform, where his passion for delivering quality software helped to keep the team focused on delivering the best possible solutions.

With a broad experience in development, from PHP to Java to C#, Reinier is able to quickly understand and adapt to new technologies and changing situations. 

In his spare time he likes sports (squash, crossfit, mountainbike), gaming (both off and online), playing guitar and drinking a good whisky or beer with his friends.
