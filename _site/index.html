            Python on Azure Functions - Round 2
          </a>
        </h3><p>A while ago a customer really wanted a solution based on Python. We already decided on Azure Functions, but Python support at that time was still in preview. I decided to evaluate exactly how preview it was. The result wasn’t really pretty: I didn’t get things to work in Azure, we gave up and told the customer we really needed to stick with C# for the time being. You can read all about it <a href="/python-on-azure-functions">in this blog post</a>.</p>

<p>Python support is still in preview, but on the one hand I know that the team has been working hard to improve things and on the other hand, the Azure Functions v2 runtime <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/introducing-azure-functions-2-0/">has reached the “general availability” status</a> which should mean that it’s production ready. So time for round 2, let’s see how things turn out this time.</p>

        </h3><p>Recently I helped <a href="https://rajbos.github.io/">Rob Bos</a> by creating an ARM template, that allowed him to spin up a VM in Azure and which would host a Chocolatey Server. Rob wrote <a href="https://rajbos.github.io/blog/2018/07/20/chocolatey-server-azure">a nice blog post</a> about this. As he mentions in his post, there are still some issues with the ARM template. On major thing is fixed though: The DSC step no longer fails and it’s no longer necessary to manually execute PowerShell. Here’s how I fixed it.</p>

        </h3><p><em>Update: Others, like Jeff Hollan, have been able to get am Azure Function working with Python. He did have to change something in the requirements.txt as well, same as I mentioned here. Have a look at <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-python-worker/issues/164">this GitHub issue</a>. I’ll give it another shot myself soon. Update: <a href="/python-on-azure-functions-round-2">Read about my second attempt here</a></em></p>

<p>Googling led me to a couple of blog posts about Python on Azure Functions. Those led me to believe Python on Azure Functions is using Windows as OS, uses a very old Python version and is very slow.
Even Microsoft’s own <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/supported-languages">Azure Functions Supported Languages</a> is stating Python isn’t supported on runtime 2.x.</p>

<p>Finally, I went to the <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-python-worker">Azure Functions Python Worker GitHub page</a> and read something a little more inspiring: Python 3.6, Linux and the 2.x runtime :-) I decided to give it a try on my Windows 10 machine with Visual Studio Code. Here is what I did and what my experience and result was like.</p>

<p>So! Time to write my first blog. Something simple first, guess I need a few posts to get into this. Judging by the amount of blogs, I’m probably not the first one starting out and probably won’t be the last so I thought I’d share what I did to set up this blog.</p>
