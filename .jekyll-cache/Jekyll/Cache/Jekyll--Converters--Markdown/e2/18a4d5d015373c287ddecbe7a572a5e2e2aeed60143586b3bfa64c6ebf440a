I"><p>My colleagues and I share a lot of knowledge, from helping out customers, to writing <a href="https://xpirit.com/inspiration/#blogs">blogs</a>), speaking at conferences and last but not least: we have our own magazine. If you haven’t received a printed copy somewhere, you can always <a href="https://xpirit.com/inspiration/#downloads">download the PDF here</a>.</p>

<p>Some of the articles are also available directly <a href="https://xpirit.com/articles/">at this page</a> and as this is my own blog ;) I’ll highlight one of the articles I wrote together with our Azure Functions expert <a href="https://blog.marcduiker.nl/">Marc Duiker</a> in magazine number 7: <strong><a href="https://xpirit.com/netcore-withvscode-should-haveunit-tests/">.NETCore.With(“vsCode”).Should().Have(“Unit Tests”)</a></strong>.</p>
