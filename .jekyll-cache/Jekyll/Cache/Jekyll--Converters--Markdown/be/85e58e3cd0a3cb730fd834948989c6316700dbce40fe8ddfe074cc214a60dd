I"ÿ<p>My colleagues and I share a lot of knowledge, from helping out customers, to writing <a href="https://xpirit.com/inspiration/#blogs">blogs</a>), speaking at conferences and last but not least: we have our own magazine. If you havenâ€™t received a printed copy somewhere, you can always <a href="https://xpirit.com/inspiration/#downloads">download the PDF here</a>.</p>

<p>Some of the articles are also available directly <a href="https://xpirit.com/articles/">at this page</a> and as this is my own blog ;) Iâ€™ll highlight one of the articles I wrote together with our Azure Functions expert <a href="https://blog.marcduiker.nl/">Marc Duiker</a> in magazine number 7: <strong><a href="https://xpirit.com/netcore-withvscode-should-haveunit-tests/">.NETCore.With(â€œvsCodeâ€).Should().Have(â€œUnit Testsâ€)</a></strong>.<!--excerpt_end--></p>

<p>As the name suggests, itâ€™s a guide on setting up a .NET Core project in VSCode, complete with unittests, multiple ways to run them and code coverage visualization. There is also a followup article which isnâ€™t available online yet, but you can read it in <a href="https://pages.xpirit.com/magazine8">magazine number 8</a>. That one goes into more detail on how to set things up when you have multiple unittest projects.</p>
