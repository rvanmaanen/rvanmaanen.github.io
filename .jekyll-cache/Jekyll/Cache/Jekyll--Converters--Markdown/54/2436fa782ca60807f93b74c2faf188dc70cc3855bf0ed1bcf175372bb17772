I"/<p>As consultant at <a href="http://www.xpirit.com/reinier">Xpirit</a>, I have experience architecting and developing backend services based on the latest technologies and frameworks. I have led the large-scale redesign of a legacy platform and also helped a number of teams develop better software, not shying away from doing the “dirty” work like organizing a backlog. From idea to production, I’m always keeping the teams focused on delivering the best possible solutions, helping out customers like ABN AMRO, VolkerWessels, StackState and VismaRAET.</p>

<p>What drives me above all else is delivering quality software, based on the latest frameworks and technologies, together with a team of motivated people. I don’t like giving up or settling for anything but the best. I’m always trying to improve: my skills, myself and the people around me.</p>

<p>In my spare time you can often find me at a CrossFit box, squashing or out in the forest mountainbiking. Other things that make me happy are playing guitar, listening to music, my friends and playing (board)games.</p>
