My colleagues and I share a lot of knowledge, from helping out customers, to writing [blogs](https://xpirit.com/inspiration/#blogs)), speaking at conferences and last but not least: we have our own magazine. If you haven't received a printed copy somewhere, you can always [download the PDF here](https://xpirit.com/inspiration/#downloads). 

Some of the articles are also available directly [at this page](https://xpirit.com/articles/) and as this is my own blog ;) I'll highlight one of the articles I wrote together with our Azure Functions expert [Marc Duiker](https://blog.marcduiker.nl/) in magazine number 7:

\>\>\> [.NETCore.With("vsCode").Should().Have("Unit Tests")](https://xpirit.com/netcore-withvscode-should-haveunit-tests/) \<\<\< <!--excerpt_end-->

As the name suggests, it's a guide on setting up a .NET Core project in VSCode, complete with unittests, multiple ways to run them and code coverage visualization. There is also a followup article which isn't available online yet, but you can read it in [magazine number 8](https://pages.xpirit.com/magazine8). That one goes into more detail on how to set things up when you have multiple unittest projects.
